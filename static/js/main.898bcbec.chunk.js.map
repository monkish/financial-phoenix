In all cases\r\n            you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before\r\n            paying down specific debts more quickly.

If you wish to save for\r\n                    college for your kids, yourself, or other relatives,\r\n                    consider a 529 fund in your state.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Save for more immediate goals.

If you're on top of your health care costs,\r\n                    future education costs, and you've made it to this step, you\r\n                    can help make a difference for others by giving. If you\r\n                    can't afford to make monetary donations, there are other\r\n                    ways to give.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    How you order those options is up to you, but the flowchart\r\n                    recommends prioritizing an HSA if you have a qualified HDHP\r\n                    and then a 529 if applicable to your situation.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    The time frame for these goals will dictate what kind of\r\n                    account you save in. For short-term goals (under 3-5 years),\r\n                    you'll want to use an FDIC-insured savings account, CDs, or\r\n                    I Bonds. If your time horizon is longer or you can afford to\r\n                    adjust your plans, you might consider something riskier like\r\n                    a balanced index fund or a three-fund portfolio (both are a\r\n                    mix of stocks and bonds). The best savings or investment\r\n                    vehicle will vary depending on time frame and risk\r\n                    tolerance.
