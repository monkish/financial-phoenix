The expenses surrounding a college education\r\n              today are astounding. According to CollegeData.com the average\r\n              annual cost of a four-year private college is $49320 per year and\r\n              public colleges can cost an average $9650 for in-state residents\r\n              and $24930 for out-of-state residents. How do you know what to\r\n              save and ensure that your kids are able to pay for college without\r\n              incurring a huge debt-burden? The best advice is to start saving\r\n              as early as possible. Are you pregnant? Start now! Additionally\r\n              encourage your friends and family to help you along the way.

In all\r\n              cases you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts\r\n              before paying down specific debts more quickly. There are two main\r\n              methods of paying down debt: In the avalanche method debts are\r\n              paid down in order of interest rate starting with the debt that\r\n              carries the highest interest rate. This is the financially optimal\r\n              method of paying down debt and you will pay less money overall\r\n              compared to the snowball method. The snowball method popularized\r\n              by Dave Ramsey debts are paid down in order of balance size\r\n              starting with the smallest. Paying off small debts first may give\r\n              you a psychological boost and improve one's cash flow situation as\r\n              paid off debts free up minimum payments. The downside is that\r\n              larger loans (that may be at higher interest rates) are left\r\n              untouched for longer costing more in the long run.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <a\r\n              class=\"CreditCard\"\r\n              href=\"http://money.com/money/collection-post/2791960/which-debts-should-i-pay-off-first/\"\r\n            >\r\n              http://money.com/money/collection-post/2791960/which-debts-should-i-pay-off-first/\r\n            </a>\r\n          </Card>\r\n\r\n          <Card\r\n            class=\"CreditCard\"\r\n            title=\"Read: How to use low interest transfer blances\r\n                    cards\"\r\n          >\r\n            <p class=\"CreditCard\">\r\n              A balance transfer allows you to move high-interest debt onto a\r\n              credit card with a lower rate — often 0% for well over a year.\r\n              Transferring a balance to one of these cards can save you hundreds\r\n              or even thousands of dollars in interest money you can apply\r\n              toward getting out of debt sooner.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <a\r\n              class=\"CreditCard\"\r\n              href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/balance-transfer\"\r\n            >\r\n              https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/balance-transfer\r\n            </a>\r\n          </Card>\r\n\r\n          <Card class=\"CreditCard\" title=\"Read: Myths about credit\">\r\n            <p class=\"CreditCard\">\r\n              Believing credit card myths can have you paying fees and interest\r\n              unnecessarily keeping cards you don’t need or not getting cards\r\n              that could earn you big rewards.

The effect of high expenses really only\r\n                    starts to bite after long periods of time and 401(k) plans\r\n                    are quite portable. After leaving a job, you can do a\r\n                    rollover of your employer plan into an IRA and sometimes you\r\n                    can roll it into a new 401(k) with a new employer. Bad\r\n                    401(k) plans can be turned into great IRAs eventually.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"section\">\r\n          <div class=\"page-center-small text-center\">\r\n            <div class=\"row\">\r\n              <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-body\">\r\n                  <i class=\"fa fa-car\" />\r\n                  <h2>Step 6:</h2>\r\n                  <h3>Save for other goals</h3>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Once you're on track for retirement, there is more\r\n                    flexibility for discretionary income. The basic options are:\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Use tax-advantaged savings for anticipated future medical\r\n                    and education costs.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    If you have an eligible high-deductible health plan (HDHP)\r\n                    and qualify, a health savings account (HSA) is a great way\r\n                    to save for future medical costs. If you wish to save for\r\n                    college for your kids, yourself, or other relatives,\r\n                    consider a 529 fund in your state.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Save for more immediate goals. Common examples include\r\n                    saving for down payments for homes, saving for vehicles,\r\n                    paying down low interest loans ahead of schedule, and\r\n                    vacation funds.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Save more so you can potentially retire early (also see\r\n                    \"advanced methods\", below), only using taxable accounts\r\n                    after maxing out tax-advantaged options.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Make an impact through giving. One of the rewards of\r\n                    practicing a sound financial lifestyle is that giving\r\n                    becomes easier. If you're on top of your health care costs,\r\n                    future education costs, and you've made it to this step, you\r\n                    can help make a difference for others by giving. If you\r\n                    can't afford to make monetary donations, there are other\r\n                    ways to give.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    How you order those options is up to you, but the flowchart\r\n                    recommends prioritizing an HSA if you have a qualified HDHP\r\n                    and then a 529 if applicable to your situation.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    The time frame for these goals will dictate what kind of\r\n                    account you save in. For short-term goals (under 3-5 years),\r\n                    you'll want to use an FDIC-insured savings account, CDs, or\r\n                    I Bonds. If your time horizon is longer or you can afford to\r\n                    adjust your plans, you might consider something riskier like\r\n                    a balanced index fund or a three-fund portfolio (both are a\r\n                    mix of stocks and bonds). The best savings or investment\r\n                    vehicle will vary depending on time frame and risk\r\n                    tolerance.

If the goal is early\r\n                    retirement (even before the age of 59½), you should\r\n                    definitely maximize the use of any available tax-advantaged\r\n                    accounts (IRA, 401(k) plans, HSA accounts, etc.) before\r\n                    using a taxable account because there are ways to get money\r\n                    out of tax-advantaged accounts before 59½ without penalty.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    If you are using a taxable account for any goal, you'll want\r\n                    to have a decent grasp on asset allocation in multiple\r\n                    accounts and tax-efficient fund placement.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n
