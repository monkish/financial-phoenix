                    <p class="15-20">Budgeting should be the cornerstone of your financial house. You should focus on
                        tracking all of your expenses for the month. Start with listing your Monthly Income. Budget out
                        with
                        four weeks of take-home pay. Take a look at your Mandatory Spending. This is all the spending
                        that
                        is related to safety and survival. Then take a look at your Debts Goals and Retirement. How much
                        you
                        put here is subjective but the faster you take care of this the quicker you can become
                        financially
                        independent. Discretionary spending is anything that's left over from your goals. Shopping
                        hobbies
                        cable coffee fast food dining and so on. Just remember: always live within your means and try to
                        save up for capital expenses before buying.</p>

                        of
                        return for savings accounts is still a measly 0.09% — or 90 cents per year for every $1000 you

                        need in retirement. Be sure to factor in your personal circumstances in order to fit the

                        reasonable to create a tiered emergency fund where the upper tiers are earning a small

                        manufacturing and information technology (IT) where soft skills and on-the-job training are
                        deemed

                        to the
                        table are now in high demand especially since many companies now offer assistantship
                        programs or
                        even paid training for high-achieving candidates. In this day and age it just might be more
                        about
                        the right skills than the right schooling.</p>

                    <p class="Kids">Saving for college in today’s world is a big challenge especially given the
                        costs. The
                        expenses surrounding a college education today are astounding. According to CollegeData.com
                        the
                        average annual cost of a four-year private college is $49320 per year and public colleges
                        can cost
                        an average $9650 for in-state residents and $24930 for out-of-state residents. How do you
                        know what
                        to save and ensure that your kids are able to pay for college without incurring a huge
                        debt-burden?
                        The best advice is to start saving as early as possible. Are you pregnant? Start now!
                        Additionally
                        encourage your friends and family to help you along the way. Every penny will help and the
                        sooner
                        you start the better you can take advantage of the miracle of compounding. If you push off
                        saving
                        your child will incur more debt.</p>

                    <p class="CreditCard">When budgeting you should use your extra money to pay down your high
                        interest debt
                        (e.g. debts much over 4% interest rate). In all cases you should make the minimum payments
                        on all of
                        your debts before paying down specific debts more quickly. There are two main methods of
                        paying down
                        debt: In the avalanche method debts are paid down in order of interest rate starting with
                        the debt
                        that carries the highest interest rate. This is the financially optimal method of paying
                        down debt
                        and you will pay less money overall compared to the snowball method. The snowball method
                        popularized
                        by Dave Ramsey debts are paid down in order of balance size starting with the smallest.
                        Paying off
                        small debts first may give you a psychological boost and improve one's cash flow situation
                        as paid
                        off debts free up minimum payments. The downside is that larger loans (that may be at higher
                        interest rates) are left untouched for longer costing more in the long run.</p>

                    <p class="CreditCard">Credit cards are far and away the most widespread form of consumer credit
                        in the
                        U.S. A credit card has a dollar limit per account up to which the cardholder and their
                        authorized
                        users are allowed to spend before being cut off. The card issuer is extending an unsecured
                        (i.e. no
                        collateral) loan up to the amount of the card limit for a period of one month. The post

                    <p class="StudentLoan">Debt consolidation is sometimes referred to as refinancing; this alludes
                        to the
                        fact that you are basically restructuring your previous debt. You are signing up for a new
                        interest
                        rate new payments and new repayment terms which means you’re signing up for a new financing
                        deal.
                        Such a product is typically offered for credit card debt (as mentioned above) student loans

                        by private lenders on the market) and mortgages (also by private companies). Every year
                        plenty of
                        people take advantage of refinancing and consolidation. Since the market interest rate is
                        constantly
                        changing many borrowers can refinance for better interest rates all in the hopes of spending
                        less.</p>
